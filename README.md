Project Description: Virtual Piano

This project is a virtual piano implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an interactive piano interface that allows users to play musical notes by clicking on the keys or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard. The piano keys produce sound using audio files associated with each note.

The code for this project is organized into several files and folders as follows:

1. Folders:
   - `sounds`: This folder contains all the audio files for each piano key. Each audio file is named according to the corresponding note it represents (e.g., `A1.mp3`, `C4.mp3`, etc.). You should place all the audio files in this folder.

2. Files:
   - `index.html`: This HTML file serves as the main entry point for the virtual piano. It includes the necessary HTML structure, references the CSS and JavaScript files, and contains the piano keys and associated functionality.

   - `style.css`: This CSS file contains the styles and layout for the virtual piano. It defines the appearance of the piano keys, background, and any animations or transitions.

   - `script.js`: This JavaScript file handles the interactivity of the virtual piano. It includes event listeners for clicking on the keys, playing the associated audio files, and adding animations or effects when a key is pressed.

   - `background.jpg` (or `background-video.mp4`): This is the background image or video file used to enhance the visual aesthetics of the virtual piano. Depending on your preference, you can use a static image or a video as the background. Ensure that the file is located in the same directory as the HTML file.

The project follows a standard file structure, where the HTML file references the CSS and JavaScript files to provide styling and functionality. The audio files for the piano keys are stored in the `sounds` folder, and the background image or video file is located in the same directory as the HTML file.

To run the project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser, ensuring that all the files and folders are located in the same directory. The virtual piano interface will be displayed, allowing you to click on the keys or use the keyboard to play musical notes.

ps: you can directly download the audio files from the repository
